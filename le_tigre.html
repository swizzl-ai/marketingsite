          “Marketing’s sending us leads, sure, but they’re tossing them over the fence with <strong>no context.</strong> We get these names, but there’s <strong>zero clarity</strong> on who’s actually worth our time! We have to spend a <strong>ton of time</strong> just figuring out if someone’s even serious—it’s like <strong>we’re guessing</strong> half the time.
        </p>
        <p>
          The real kicker? We have no idea why these people are here in the first place. Why are they looking at our product? What’s driving them? That’s the gold we need to actually close, and that’s the most valuable insight that only my top salespeople uncover consistently.”

            <strong>Qualify:</strong> You’re getting leads but it’s hard to know who to focus on (and who not to). We weed out those who won’t buy.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Accelerate:</strong> Prospects are showing you positive signals but some just can’t seem to decide or just randomly disappear. We accelerate interested but skittish prospects.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Win Trust:</strong> Getting to the “why” takes time, effort, experience, and luck and it’s still hard. We get you the why before the first call, starting you on second base.
